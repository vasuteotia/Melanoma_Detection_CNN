# CNN based model to accurately detect melanoma
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
Provide general information about your project here.
We will be using CNN Technique for detecting melanoma.

What is the background of your project?
In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Convolutional Neural Network Technique. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Healthcare Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like predicting Skin Cancer accurately using CNN.

Business Problem Statement:
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

What is the dataset that is being used?
We have got dataset from dataset from Upgrad

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
